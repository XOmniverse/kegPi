## Contributing to KegPi
Right now, it's simply a personal project, but I'd love to see how it morphs and changes. If you want to contribute, please do the following:

### Fork the KegPi Repo:
Fork KegPi [on Github](https://github.com/asachs01/kegPi)

    git clone https://github.com/asachs01/kegPi.git
    cd kegPi
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/asachs01/kegPi.git

Make a pull request, which will get reviewed and pulled in, pending that the changes you make don't cause things to explode.
